How to create a lookup table (.raw):


in the player folder, setup the darwin to take some pictures:
cd ~/dev/merc/UPENN2013/Player
sudo su
screen -S dcm
lua run_dcm.lua
(now press ctrl+a, then ctrl+d to have it run int he background)
screen -S player
lua run_cognition.lua
(now press ctrl+a, then ctrl+d again)

lua run_monitor.lua

Now to grab those images (use startx for these instructions):
cd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a/bin
sudo matlab
in matlab:
cd ~/dev/merc/UPENN2013/Tools/Matlab
startup
LoggerShm(19,1) 

Wait 20 years for gui
click "log" button.

close gui, back to matlab. run
startup
colortable
In the gui, load montage
go to the logs directory, your log should be there with a timestamp. open it

click the color you want to select on the radio buttons. 

it is important to note that you should only click the buttons one at a time, as the client will queue them all up and take forever.

then click that color. wait about 10 seconds per click.

export LUT
